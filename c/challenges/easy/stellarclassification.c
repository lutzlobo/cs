/*
You're an astronomer cataloguing different types of stars. In the course of your observations, you've discovered several stars and classified them according to the Morganâ€“Keenan (MK) system (O, B, A, F, G, K, M), where 'O' represents the hottest stars and 'M' the coolest ones.

However, your list of observations is in a random order, and for your research paper, you need to present the stars in the order of their classification, from hottest to coolest.

Your task is to write a program that sorts an array of characters representing the star types in the order defined by the MK system.
